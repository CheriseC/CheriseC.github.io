        <p>Hey everyone, I'm Cherise and I'm learning to love myself. I'm sure you're used to hearing everyone say that by now. But let me just tell you, it is not as easy and glamorous as it looks on social media. It's hard work.</p>

        <p>See, I'm the girl that has a hard time saying no and has a hard time putting herself first. I'm the girl that takes it very personally if she ever disappoints anyone. It's because of those things why I never get any sleep. I don't always have full meals in the day and I don't get to see my friends or enjoy my family. I'm the girl that's stressed, frazzled, distressed and always <em>exhausted.</em></p>

        <p>But I'm turning over a new leaf because I no longer want to be that girl. I want to be able to prioritize my health and others in a balanced way. I want to be strong enough to set boundaries for myself. I want to feel good about myself and wake up happy to just be me.</p>

        <p>This is a website where you are free to laugh at my struggles but also welcome to join the journey of becoming a happier you. It's up to you if you happen to find this!</p>
