        <p>There are things in this world that we love to do. We either take those things for granted or we don't give ourselves the time to discover them. There is so much art, hobbies and skills in this world that can give us the type of joy we miss out on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Maybe you know what things give you joy or maybe you haven't found it yet. But it's important to just do the things that make ourselves happy.</p>

        <p>I love doing creative things and trying to learn new skills. I've tried D.I.Y's, crocheting, guitar, piano, salsa and more. But the thing that gives me the most joy, besides dancing, is acting.</p>
        <p>But no matter what it is that we enjoy, we have to find a way to incorporate it into our daily schedule - which to me is the the hardest part. Everything else always seem to take precedence over the things we enjoy doing. But maybe if we schedule time at least once a week to start off, we can start including it more regularly into our schedule.</p>
