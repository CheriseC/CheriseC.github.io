      <h1>Cherise Clough</h1>

      <h2>Hi, Everyone!</h2>

      <p>I'm Cherise and this is my first time building a web page. I know, crazy right? I never thought I would be a coder, but I have to say I'm really liking it so far. Since you don't know me yet, I've listed some things about me down below!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I <em>really</em> love dancing</li>
        <li>I'm really bad at texting people back</li>
        <li>I want to travel and experience the world</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Story</h2>

      <p>I was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica. I was born on <time datetime="2000-10-16T06:00">October 16, 2000 at 6 a.m.</time> I have no idea why I decided to pop out so early in the morning. I despise early mornings. I'm a night owl through and through. Don't get me wrong, I admire anyone who is a morning person. It seems so peaceful and calming to wake up at dawn and have that time to yourself. Trust me, I'm jealous. I wish I could gracefully wake up at <time datetime="05:00">5 a.m.</time>, make my tea, meditate, go for a morning run and make myself a delicious breakfast - all before <time datetime="08:00">8 a.m.</time> But as soon as my alarm starts blaring, my brain instantly <del>fights</del> <ins>attacks</ins> me for disturbing its rest. Trust me, it is not pretty.
      </p>

      <h2>Break Time!</h2>

      <p>And now, here's a break from my rambling. Please enjoy this random picture of a cute octocat!</p>

      <h2>Story <abbr title="Continued">Cont</abbr></h2>

      <p>I just realized, I could totally code my diary on here! Yes I have a diary, don't judge. If only I had a lot of free time. Between school, work and salsa, I feel as though I barely have any time for myself. This was the same problem I faced last year but I'm trying to do better this year. If anyone knows how to juggle doing a million things at once while maintaining self care rituals without plummetting into a depressing and stressful dark cycle, please let me know in the comments below - of course, after I learn how to code a comment section. But just know, I'm open to all suggestions, even ones from the morning risers. Disclaimer: I also don't drink coffee or energy drinks so those suggestions won't help me. Otherwise, feel free to let me know. And that's all for now. Until next time, bye everyone!</p>

      <h2>Parting Message</h2>
      <p>There's no one else like you. Embrace everything that makes you, <strong>You!</strong>
